# R10.2 — Status-update lifecycle (link to lead meeting, edit/delete, late marking)

**Status:** tests passing
**Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` + DDL (**DB change**: `StatusUpdate.calendarEventId`)
- `src/lib/actions/status-updates.ts` (submit/edit/delete + window/late logic + permission gating)
- `src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/status/new/page.tsx` (link to the lead meeting; window gating)
- the project page (`canSubmitStatus` window) + the status history/timeline views (inline edit/delete)

**Depends on:** R10.1 (LEAD_MEETING type + `statusSubmitWindowDays`).

## Spec

**Problem:** Status updates today use a free `meetingDate` field and a fixed `submissionDeadlineHours`.
The user wants each status update to **correspond to a project's lead meeting** (on the calendar), with
this lifecycle:
1. "Submit Update" only appears within the configurable window (R10.1) **before** the lead meeting.
2. A **lead** can **edit/delete their own** status update **before** the meeting/due time.
3. A submission **after** due is **allowed but marked late**.
4. After due, a lead can **no longer edit** their update.
5. Users with the right permission (**PM + Eboard**) can **edit/delete any** status update **at any
   time** — done **inline**, with the deliverable/subtask **✓/✗ confirm microinteractions**.

**Approach:**

*DB:* `StatusUpdate.calendarEventId String?` → FK to the lead-meeting `CalendarEvent` (per-project).
`ALTER TABLE "StatusUpdate" ADD COLUMN "calendarEventId" TEXT REFERENCES "CalendarEvent"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;`
The "due time" is the linked lead meeting's `startsAt`. Keep `isLate` (computed: submitted after
`startsAt`, or after `startsAt − statusSubmitWindowDays`? → **due = `startsAt`; late = submitted after
`startsAt`**; the window only governs when the button appears). Reconcile/retire the free `meetingDate`
+ `submissionDeadlineHours` (migrate `meetingDate` semantics to the linked meeting).

*Submit gating:* the project's "Submit Update" shows only when the project has an upcoming
LEAD_MEETING within `statusSubmitWindowDays`, and the user is a lead/sublead. The submit form links to
that meeting (sets `calendarEventId`); `isLate = now > meeting.startsAt`.

*Lead edit/delete (own, pre-due):* on the status-update record (history/timeline view), a lead who
owns it sees inline **Edit** + **Delete** **only while `now <= meeting.startsAt`**. Inline edit reuses
the Markdown/InlineConfirm patterns; delete uses the armed ✓/✗ confirm (like R9.2).

*Privileged edit/delete (PM + Eboard, any time):* users with the gating permission (recommend a new
`MANAGE_STATUS_UPDATES`, or reuse `MANAGE_PROJECTS` + Eboard) get inline Edit/Delete on **any** status
update regardless of due time.

*Server actions:* add `updateStatusUpdate(id, formData)` and `deleteStatusUpdate(id)` with the gating:
owner-lead-before-due **OR** privileged. `submitStatusUpdate` sets `calendarEventId` + `isLate`.

## Tests
- [x] DDL applied (`calendarEventId` FK, `MANAGE_STATUS_UPDATES` — see fix.sql); seed grants it to
      PM + Eboard; `prisma generate` + dev restart; `pnpm build` passes
- [x] Playwright: "Submit Update" is hidden until the project has a lead meeting open for submission,
      then appears and links to that meeting
- [x] Playwright: an upcoming (in-window) meeting → on-time submission (no Late badge); a past meeting
      → submission **marked Late**
- [x] Playwright: a privileged user (PM, MANAGE_STATUS_UPDATES) edits (modal) + deletes (inline ✓/✗
      confirm) a status update from the project page
- [~] Lead-only-before-due edit/delete: enforced server-side (`assertCanModifyStatusUpdate`) +
      gated in UI (`canModifyStatusUpdate` checks own + lead + now<=meeting). Not separately UI-tested
      (dev-login can't easily make a non-privileged ACTIVE lead distinct from the PM)
- [x] Deleting the lead meeting nulls the link (FK ON DELETE SET NULL; due then falls back to meetingDate)

## Notes / log
- 2026-06-28 — Specced (Set 10, phase 2). No code written. Open: keep vs retire `meetingDate` /
  `submissionDeadlineHours`; exact privileged permission (new `MANAGE_STATUS_UPDATES` vs `MANAGE_PROJECTS`).

- 2026-06-28 — Implemented & Playwright-verified. `getActiveLeadMeeting` (lib); submit links the meeting + derives meetingDate + isLate(now>startsAt); button gated on an active meeting; status/new shows the meeting (no free date field). `updateStatusUpdate`/`deleteStatusUpdate` gated by `assertCanModifyStatusUpdate` (privileged anytime, owner-lead before due). Inline `StatusUpdateControls` (edit modal + ✓/✗ delete). Branch: `feat/set10/R10.2-status-lifecycle`.

## Review feedback — round 2 (2026-06-28)

**Problems found in validation:**
1. The **dashboard** still showed "No update submitted yet · Submit update →" for every assigned
   project regardless of the lead meeting — its widget was never gated on the lead meeting / window
   (only the project page was). It should appear on the dashboard only when the project has an active
   lead meeting in the window **and** nothing has been submitted for it yet.
2. The submit-window setting was hard to find — it sat next to the now-**obsolete** "Submission
   deadline (hours before meeting)" field (R10.2 retired `submissionDeadlineHours` as the status
   late-marking source), which was confusing.

**Fixes:**
- New `getStatusSubmissionState(projectId)` (lib): active lead meeting + whether an update already
  exists for it → `canSubmit = active && !submitted`.
- **Project page:** `canSubmitStatus = isLead && submissionState.canSubmit` (adds the "not yet
  submitted" condition). "Submission history →" stays unconditionally at the bottom.
- **Dashboard:** the per-project Submit CTA is gated on `canSubmit` (active meeting + not submitted +
  the user is LEAD/SUBLEAD of that project) and is **hidden** otherwise. CTA text is now "Status update
  due".
- **Settings:** removed the obsolete "Submission deadline (hours)" field (and its handling in
  `updateSettings`); the single, clear **"Status submit window (days before a lead meeting)"** remains.

**Round-2 tests:**
- [x] Playwright: no lead meeting → Submit hidden on dashboard AND project page; the "Submission
      history" link is still present
- [x] Playwright: a lead meeting in window → Submit shows on both; after submitting → hidden on both
- [x] Playwright: the submit window is configurable in PM settings and persists

## Review feedback — round 3 (2026-06-28)

Two issues from validation — a **model bug** (the button never appeared) and a **naming** change.

### 1. Lead meetings are GLOBAL per semester, not per-project (bug)

**Wrong assumption (rounds 1–2):** `getActiveLeadMeeting` filtered by the *meeting's* `projectId`, so
it only matched a lead meeting explicitly linked to that project. But the PM schedules **leads
meetings** on the calendar for **all** leads — they are not tied to one project. So a normal leads
meeting (no/other project) was never found → the Submit button never appeared anywhere. (The e2e tests
passed only because they happened to link the meeting to the project.)

**Correct model:** a lead meeting applies to **every project in its semester**. The submission window
opens `statusSubmitWindowDays` before each lead meeting; if the PM puts meetings on consecutive days
the windows **overlap into one continuous period** (e.g. two meetings one day apart with a 3-day window
→ ~4 days of availability). While we're outside every lead meeting's window → no Submit button at all;
once inside **at least one** lead meeting's window → the button appears on the project page **and** the
dashboard for that project's leads.

**Fix:** `getActiveLeadMeeting(projectId)` now scopes by the **project's semester** (looks up the
project's `semester`) and finds the **latest** `LEAD_MEETING` in that semester with
`startsAt <= now + windowDays` — **not** filtered by the meeting's `projectId`. A project is "already
submitted" when a `StatusUpdate` exists for `(projectId, calendarEventId = that meeting)`. (Lead
meetings are created without a project; the calendar editor's "Project (optional)" is irrelevant to
this lookup.) e2e helper `createLeadMeeting` updated to create the meeting in the project's semester
(via `/calendar?semester=…`) and to stop linking it to a project.

### 2. Rename "status update" → "Project Standing" (it collides with deliverable/subtask *status*)

"Status" already means deliverable/subtask status and the project ON_TRACK/AT_RISK status, so the
submission feature is renamed throughout the **UI** (not the deliverable/subtask/project status, and
not DB columns / code identifiers):
- "Submit Update" / "Submit Status" → **"Submit Project Standing"**
- "Submission history" → **"Project Standing History"**
- "Status Update" (the submission page/section/modal) → **"Project Standing"**
- "Recent Status Updates" → **"Recent Project Standings"**
- "Status update due" (dashboard CTA) → **"Project standing due"**
- Other user-facing copy: history page header/labels, the landing-page blurb, the notification-engine
  notification title/body ("Status update missing…" → "Project standing missing…"), the
  MISSING_SUBMISSION settings label, and the MCP tool description, where they refer to this submission.
  (Leave `SUBMIT_STATUS_UPDATES` permission label, DB tables/columns, and `submitStatusUpdate`/
  `status-updates.ts` identifiers as-is — internal names.)

**Round-3 tests:**
- [x] Playwright: a global LEAD_MEETING (created with no project, in the project's semester, inside the
      window) makes the Submit button appear on the dashboard AND the project page; outside the window
      → hidden; after submitting → hidden (`r10-submit-gating`, `r10-status-lifecycle`)
- [x] App: renamed throughout — button "Submit Project Standing", bottom link "Project Standing
      History", section "Recent Project Standings", dashboard CTA, status/new page, edit modal
- [x] Full e2e suite green (33 passed; lead meetings now isolated per-semester in tests)

## Review feedback — round 4 (2026-06-28)

**Problem (reported):** "When I place a leads meeting in the calendar, the Submit Project Standing button
still doesn't show up on the project page or the dashboard."

**Root cause (reproduced with Playwright):** the round-3 gating matched a lead meeting to a project by
**exact free-text `semester` string equality** (`getActiveLeadMeeting` used `semester: project.semester`).
When a PM places a leads meeting on the calendar, the event silently inherits whatever semester the
**calendar is currently showing** (it defaults to the most-recent semester alphabetically). If that string
isn't character-for-character identical to the project's semester, the meeting governed **no** projects
and the button never appeared — with no feedback. The round-1–3 tests never caught this because the e2e
helper passed the *same* semester string to both `createProject` and `createLeadMeeting`. A repro test
that created the meeting under the calendar's *default* semester showed count = 0.

**Fix (chosen with the user): explicit semester pinning + a no-typo semester picker.**
- *DB:* `CalendarEvent.semesters String[] @default([])` — the set of semesters a lead/eboard meeting is
  pinned to (always includes the primary `semester`; for other event types it's just `[semester]`).
  DDL: `ALTER TABLE "CalendarEvent" ADD COLUMN "semesters" TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}';` then backfill
  `UPDATE "CalendarEvent" SET "semesters" = ARRAY["semester"] WHERE "semesters" = '{}';` (via
  `scripts/apply-schema.ts`).
- *Gating:* `getActiveLeadMeeting` now matches `semesters: { has: project.semester }` instead of exact
  `semester` equality. A leads meeting governs **every project whose semester is in its pinned set**.
- *Calendar editor:* when the event type is **LEAD_MEETING / EBOARD_MEETING**, a checkbox group ("Applies
  to semesters", `data-testid="meeting-semesters"`) lets the PM pin the meeting to any set of existing
  semesters; the active semester is pre-checked. `createEvent`/`updateEvent` read `semesters[]` (helper
  `resolveSemesters`); submit is disabled until ≥1 semester is picked. Calendar list query filters by
  `semesters has activeSemester`, so a multi-pinned meeting shows in each of its semesters.
- *Semester picker (no-typo guard):* new `SemesterField` / `SemesterFormField` (`src/components/
  semester-field.tsx`) — a dropdown of existing semesters plus a "+ New semester…" custom option. Used on
  the New Project page and in the Edit-project modal so project + meeting semester strings can't silently
  diverge.

**Files (round 4):** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/lib/lead-meeting.ts`, `src/lib/actions/calendar.ts`,
`src/app/(app)/calendar/page.tsx`, `src/components/semester-calendar.tsx`, `src/components/semester-field.tsx`
(new), `src/app/(app)/projects/new/page.tsx`, `src/components/project-modal.tsx`,
`src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `e2e/helpers.ts`, `e2e/r10-semester-pinning.spec.ts` (new).

**Round-4 tests:**
- [x] `pnpm build` passes (typecheck clean)
- [x] Playwright (`r10-semester-pinning`): a lead meeting pinned to a **different** semester leaves the
      button hidden on both project page and dashboard; pinning a meeting to the project's **own**
      semester makes it appear on both
- [x] Playwright (`r10-semester-pinning`): one meeting pinned to **two** semesters opens the button for a
      project in each
- [x] Playwright: existing `r10-submit-gating` + `r10-status-lifecycle` still green with the new
      semester-picker + pinning helpers
- [x] Visual verification by the user (passed); full e2e regression sweep started but stopped early
      on the user's go-ahead to merge — the round-4 + R10.2 targeted suites above are green
